= HttpClient Utilities

This is an utility class that lets you send an http request to a web site to retrieve and process its response.

.Example on how to use the HttpClient utility.
[source,java]
----


// at first define a callback that handles the response
// for demonstration it reads the html content and returns it to the caller
HttpClientUtils.ResponseCallBack callback = new HttpClientUtils.ResponseCallBack() {
	public String run(HttpResponse response) {
		System.out.println("incoming response!");
		try {
			InputStream inputStream = response.getEntity().getContent();
			
			StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
			IOUtils.copy(inputStream, writer, encoding);
			String result = writer.toString();
			inputStream.close();
			return result;
		} catch(IOException ioex) {
			// mostly caused by connection reset by peer or connection abortion
			// handle error here
			return "error...";
		}
	}
};

// define an url to retrieve its HTML content
String myUrl = "http://www.google.de";

// now the proxyHost has to be defined
HttpHost proxyHost = new HttpHost("proxy.your-company.de", 8080, "http");

// if we would set autoProxy to true the the method would construct its proxy by using the 
// standard System Properties http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort, 
// so then we would and pass null as proxyHost
boolean autoProxy = false;

// we set also a proper timeout in milliseconds
int timeout = 60000;

// we want to see all log methods of the process
boolean suppressLogs = false;

// send out the request and get the content / error
String htmlString = HttpClientUtils.request(myUrl, autoProxy, proxyHost, timeout, callback, suppressLogs);

----

There is also a simpler version of this method that takes only the url and the callback. 
The defaults for this method are autoProxy=true, timeout=10000, suppressLogs=false.
