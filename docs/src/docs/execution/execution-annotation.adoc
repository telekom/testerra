= Annotations for Report adjustment

include::../properties/property-attributes.adoc[]
To improve the readability and clarity of the report there are several annotations for marking the test class and test methods,
which are described in the following paragraph as well as in <<#Fails, @Fails>>, <<#Retry, @Retry>> and <<#NoRetry, @NoRetry>>.

== @TestClassContext
With this annotation you can set the test context for the given test class. There two attributes for adjustments.

* name: name of the context, default = `""`
* mode: `TestClassContext.Mode.ONE_FOR_ALL` or `TestClassContext.Mode.ONE_FOR_EACH`, default = `TestClassContext.Mode.ONE_FOR_ALL`

The Executed tests are then shown in the classes overview of the report as a entry labeled with `name` from `@TestClassContext`.
