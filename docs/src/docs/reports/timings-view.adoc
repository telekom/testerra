= Timings View

== Tests tab pane
All executed test cases are included in a bar chart, grouped in ranges by their execution time.
By hovering over a bar the methods within this range are listed in a tooltip.

It is possible to adjust the number of method ranges by selecting a value of 5, 10, 15 or 20 in the corresponding drop-down menu.
This way you can adjust the resolution of the chart.

You can also search for a specific method by entering the name of the test case in the searchbar.
The corresponding bar is then highlighted.

By default, only the test methods themselves are included.
However, it is possible to incorporate the configuration methods by toggling the switch located in the top right corner of the view.

== Sessions tab pane
In the scatter chart you can see every session that was started in the test execution.
On the x-axis, the starting time of session is indicated, while the loading duration is represented on the y-axis.

When hovering over any of the dots, a tooltip appears providing details regarding the browser and its version, the session name and ID, along with the test cases executed within that session.

If a base URL is configured, the load duration and timestamp of the base URL are also displayed.
In this scenario, the two dots are linked, as the base URL is consistently loaded at session startup.
Note that setting up a base URL is optional.
If both dots exist, the hover effect will clarify which base URL dot corresponds to each session dot.

Navigation:

* Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out on the y-axis.
* Move the mouse while holding the left button to scroll vertically.
* It is also possible to use the buttons in the upper right corner to zoom into a specific area, reset the zoom and restore the chart.
