= Dashboard View

The dashboard view gives an overview of the last test execution. It shows the total number of executed tests and of passed, skipped or failed tests.

On the Breakdown panel is a pie chart that shows the proportions, displayed with different colors according to the test status.

Test status colors:
[cols="2,^1,4",options="header"]
|===
| Color | Test Status | Description
| Green | Passed | The test was passed.
| Yellow | Skipped | The test was not executed, because a test it depends on failed.
| Red | Failed | The test failed.
| Dark Red | Expected Fail | The test failed, as expected e.g. because of a nown bug or problem

Check out the <<#Fails, @Fails>> Annotation to see how to mark a test as expected to fail.

Right beside the Breakdown pie chart you find another panel with the Top 3 failure types (aspects).
There are two more panels below, one displaying detailed information about test execution duration, start and end times and another panel with a list of test classes that reports how many tests did pass, fail or were skipped in the individual test classes.
