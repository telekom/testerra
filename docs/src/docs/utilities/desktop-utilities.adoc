= Desktop WebDriver utilities

This utility class provides some additional methods to interact with web elements.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please consider this utility class as a fallback solution.

It could be useful if elements are hidden or not reachable by Selenium.

== Supported actions

.A short clickJS example
[source,java]
----
UiElement element = find(By.id("label"));
DesktopWebDriverUtils utils = new DesktopWebDriverUtils();

utils.clickJS(element);
----

The following methods are supported:

* clickJS()
* rightClickJS()
* doubleClickJS()
* mouseOverJS()
* clickAbsolute()
* mouseOverAbsolute2Axis()
* clickByImage()
* mouseOverByImage()

See <<Mouse over>> for more details about the `mouseOverAbsolute2Axis` method.

== `mouseOver` vs. `mouseOverAbsolute2Axis`

The `mouseOverAbsolute2Axis` method does not move the mouse pointer relativly from the last position.

The following graphic shows 2 different mouse pointer paths beginning at the upper right image to the button 1.

.Two possible mouse paths

The standard path (green) goes over a menu with hover effects.
This could hide your target element.
The blue path variant always goes first to the point (0,0) of the viewport, then in x and y direction the the target element.

== By-image-utils

The `clickByImage` and `mouseOverByImage` methods use the image recognition technology of sikuli-api to locate a part of the current web page using a screenshot placed in the `src/test/resources/` directory.
After the referenced element was found, the operation is performed (either click or mouseOver) at the corresponding location, the center of the found screen region, using Selenium actions.

These methods are useful, if some elements can not be accessed in the usual way, for example if they are inside a canvas or svg element.

The following graphic shows the report-ng threads view with a selected testcase in the method filter, which is visible on the page but cannot be accessed since the chart is a canvas element.

.A screenshot used to find the selected testcase

With a screenshot of this method, in this case "test_expectedFailed.png", the by-image-utils can be used to find this element and perform a mouseOver or click action in the center of the test method bar.
