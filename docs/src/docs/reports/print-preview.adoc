= Print preview

If you want to consolidate all report information into a single PDF file or print it directly, the "Print Report" feature
can be accessed by clicking the button located at the bottom of the navigation drawer.

On the left side, a preview shows how the printed report might appear. It includes an indicator displaying the estimated
page count as you scroll through the content.

On the right side, you will find various settings that allow you to customize the contents of the preview. By clicking
the "Print" button, the final version will be sent to the browserâ€™s print dialog, where you can print the report or download it as a PDF file.
