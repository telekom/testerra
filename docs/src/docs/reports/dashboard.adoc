= Dashboard View

== Overview

The dashboard view gives an overview of the last test execution. It shows the total number of executed tests and of passed, skipped or failed tests.

On the Breakdown panel is a pie chart that shows the proportions, displayed with different colors according to the test status.

Right beside the Breakdown pie chart you find another panel with the Top 3 failure types (aspects).
There are two more panels below, one displaying detailed information about test execution duration, start and end times and another panel with a list of test classes that reports how many tests did pass, fail or were skipped in the individual test classes.

== Status definitions

Testerra defines the following *final 4 statuses* which describe the final test result:

[cols="1a,4",options="header"]
|===
| Test Status | Description

| image::status_passed.png[]
| The test was successful.

| image::status_failed.png[]
| The test was failed.

| image::status_skipped.png[]
| The test was not executed because a precondition failed like a configuration method, a data provider or  an another test.

| image::status_expected_failed.png[]
| The test failed as expected and the test method is annotated with <<#Fails, @Fails>> because of a known bug or problem.

|===

Additional to the statuses above Testerra defines some more _sub statuses_:

[cols="1a,4",options="header"]
|===
| Test Status | Description

| image::status_retried.png[]
| The test failed at it's first try. Testerra executed that test again if the <<#_retry_analyzer, RetryAnalyzer>> was active.

| image::status_recovered.png[]
| The test was passed at it's second (third...) execution if the <<#_retry_analyzer, RetryAnalyzer>> was active.

| image::status_repaired.png[]
| The test was passed but it is still annotated with `@Fails`. The annotation can be removed now.

|===

[NOTE]
====
* The dashboard only shows the final statuses in the 'Breakdown' and 'Test Classes' charts.
* The 'Tests' table summarize all executed tests inclusive retried tests. Recovered and repaired tests belong to passed tests.
* The tests view shows all tests with their detailed status.
