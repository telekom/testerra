= Dashboard View

== Overview

The dashboard view provides an overview of the latest test execution.
It displays the total number of executed tests, along with counts of passed, skipped, and failed tests.

The Breakdown panel includes a pie chart showing the proportions of test results, color-coded by test status.

Directly below the pie chart, a panel displays detailed information about test execution duration, as well as start and end times.
Beneath that, another panel lists the executed test classes, showing how many tests passed, failed, or were skipped within each class.

== Status definitions

Testerra defines the following *final 4 statuses* which describe the final test result:

[cols="1a,4",options="header"]
|===
| Test Status | Description

| image::status_passed.png[]
| The test was successful.

| image::status_failed.png[]
| The test was failed.

| image::status_skipped.png[]
| The test was not executed because a precondition failed like a configuration method, a data provider or  an another test.

| image::status_expected_failed.png[]
| The test failed as expected and the test method is annotated with <<#Fails, @Fails>> because of a known bug or problem.

|===

Additional to the statuses above Testerra defines some more _sub statuses_:

[cols="1a,4",options="header"]
|===
| Test Status | Description

| image::status_retried.png[]
| The test failed at it's first try. Testerra executed that test again if the <<#_retry_analyzer, RetryAnalyzer>> was active.

| image::status_recovered.png[]
| The test was passed at it's second (third...) execution if the <<#_retry_analyzer, RetryAnalyzer>> was active.

| image::status_repaired.png[]
| The test was passed but it is still annotated with `@Fails`. The annotation can be removed now.

[NOTE]
====
* The dashboard only shows the final statuses in the 'Breakdown' and 'Test Classes' charts.
* The 'Tests' table summarize all executed tests inclusive retried tests.
Recovered and repaired tests belong to passed tests.
* The tests view shows all tests with their detailed status.
