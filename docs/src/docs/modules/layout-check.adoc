= Layout Check

Layout tests always mean checking whether a GUI is designed according to the guidelines.

== Introduction

Are the position, size, color and shape of the elements correct? Are distances maintained? Perhaps even certain elements are missing? In test automation, functionality is primarily tested. Here it is actually irrelevant how a button is designed and where it is positioned. The main thing is that the element can be uniquely recognized via XPath or CSS selectors.

However, in some frontends such as content management systems with a high level of relevance to end users (certain portal solutions, shops) the management is also extremely important. However, testing this with Selenium's previous means is not in any relation between effort and benefit. Manual visual inspection is usually still the fastest way to do this.

Although, manual inspection can never be pixel-accurate. An inspection of perhaps more than 100 elements is too costly. Smaller shifts or colour deviations are easily overlooked.

At this point an automatic comparison of reference screenshots can help. This test is to be seen in addition to the functional tests, but cannot replace them. In a test case, it would also be conceivable to combine the check of function and layout.

== How it works

A layout test with the Testerra utilities is actually a comparison between a reference and the actual state. This is done via the screenshot functionality of Selenium, in which both screenshots (reference and actual) are compared pixel by pixel from top to bottom. In this comparison, a third image is created in which differences (ReferencePixel != ActualPixel) are marked in red.

There are two different ways in which Testerra handles different sized images.
Using the property `{layoutcheck_pixel_count_hard_assertion}`, you can customize the handling of such cases.

If the property is set to `false` (default) Testerra reports this as an <<#_optional_assertions, Optional assertion>>. Only the common pixels of both images as considered as 100% for the calculation. Pixels that are outside of one or the other image are not included in the error calculation.

With the property set to `true`, the size difference of the two images is included in the calculation so that all pixels that appear in only one image counted as incorrect ones.

In both scenarios, all pixels outside one or the other image are marked in blue in the generated distance image.

=== Prerequisites
The following prerequisites must be met

- Concrete execution environment: Layout tests should run in a concrete browser environment to ensure the comparability of the screenshots.
- Size of browser window: Define fixed size to exclude different sizes of the images at different screen resolutions.
- Screen resolution: Make sure you have the same screen resolution on each presentation device.
- Scaling: The scaling should always be set to 100%. Using a different scaling causes variations in the positions of the elements on the website. For more details, see this https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/4725[Selenium issue].

== Configuration

In order to get the layout check to work, you need at least a reference image and a place where it's located.

.test.properties
[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
{layoutcheck_reference_path}=src/test/resources/layout-references/{tt.browser}
{layoutcheck_reference_nametemplate}=%s.png

# Highly recommended to disable full screen for browser
{browser_maximize}=false

# Highly recommended to switch of the demo mode for layout tests
{demomode}=false
----
The directory for reference image may result in `src/test/resources/layout-references/chrome/WelcomePage.png` for example.

The comparison is generally carried out over the entire reference image. In this case, it is a prerequisite that the reference screenshot and the screenshot created during the test runtime have the same resolution (height and width are identical).

== Check the whole page

[source, java]
----
// 1% of the pixels are allowed to be different
float pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent = 1.0;

page.expect().screenshot().pixelDistance("WelcomePage").isLowerThan(pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent);
----

TIP: To organize the reference screenshots in subfolders you can add the relative structure to the name like `my/additional/folder/WelcomePage`.

== Check a single UiElement

To check the layout of a single UiElement only, you can use the standard asserts implementation.

[source, java]
----
// 10% of the pixels are allowed to be different
float pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent = 10.0;

uiElement.expect().screenshot().pixelDistance("HeaderComponent").isLowerThan(pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent);
----

== Check images with RGB deviation

The property `{layoutcheck_pixel_rgb_deviation_percent}` controls, which color difference in percentage of a single pixel is count as a match. You can use that value to handle slightly changes in color or alpha values.

Especially for photo checks it should be helpful in case of different kinds of image formats and compression algorithms.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|===
| `{layoutcheck_pixel_rgb_deviation_percent}=0.0` | `{layoutcheck_pixel_rgb_deviation_percent}=2.0`
| image::layoutcheck_rgb_deviation01.png[alt="Screenshot of the report visualization of a layout check"] | image::layoutcheck_rgb_deviation02.png[alt="Screenshot of the report visualization of a layout check"]
|===

== Check image files

In case you don't want to check a screenshot of the browser but rather a pre-existing image, there is also a way to do that.
The `assertImage` method requires the `File` object of the actual image and executes a layout check.

[source, java]
----
// 5% of the pixels are allowed to be different
float pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent = 5.0;

File absoluteFile = FileUtils.getResourceFile("images/actual.png");
LayoutCheck.assertImage(absoluteFile, "reference", pixelDistanceToleranceThresholdPercent);
----

== Take reference screenshots on first run

When you have configured the reference screenshots location and implemented the tests, you can now set the option

[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
{layoutcheck_takereference}=true
----
to enable taking automatically screenshots based on the current browser and size configuration and storing them to the reference image's location.

WARNING: All concrete distance values in this {layoutcheck_takereference}-mode will return `0` (zero) and always pass the tests.

== Reporting

Report-NG provides a good presentation of the results of layout checks. See <<#_layout_checks, here>> for more details.
