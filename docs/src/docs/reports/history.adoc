= History

The Testerra report can display historical data from previous test runs.
By default, results from up to 50 executions are stored and displayed.
This limit can be adjusted by setting the {reporthistorymaxtestruns} property to a different value.
If the limit is exceeded, the oldest results are automatically deleted.

== How to use the history?

When executing a test set for the first time, placeholders are shown because there is no previous run available yet.
You need to execute the test set at least twice to view historical data in the report.
Testerra uses the locally saved test results, stored in the report directory (which can be configured via the {reportdir} property), to build the history.
Therefore, ensure that previous test results are locally available to enable history features.
