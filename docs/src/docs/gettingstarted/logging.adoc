= Logging

The log configuration prints out to `System.out` by default.
If you want to have more control over several log levels of classes, add a `log4j2.xml` to your `resources/`.

.log4j2.xml
[source, xml]
----
include::../../res/log4j2.xml[]
----

You can also change the root log level from the command line via.
[source, bash]
----
-Dlog4j.level=DEBUG
----

== Log own messages

The `Loggable` interface provide some logging features and always uses the current instance class as logger name.

[source,java]
----
class MyClass implements Loggable {

    public void doSomething() {
        log().info("Do something");
    }
}
----

Which results in a log message similar to

[source]
----
[main][INFO][MCID:xyz][SCID:abc]: MyClass - Do something
----

The markers `MCID` and `SCID` are referencing to the current MethodContext respectively SessionContext ID.

NOTE: Important messages can be prompted to the Report. See <<Priority Messages, here>> for more details.
