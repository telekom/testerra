[#Fails]
= Expected Fails

For known issues on the SUT the annotation `@Fails` can used to mark a test method as failing. These test cases are marked as `Expected failed` separately in the report.

If tests are passed again, you get a note in the report to remove the `Fails` annotation.

[source,java]
----
@Test
@Fails()
public void testItWillFail() {
    Assert.assertTrue(false);
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The result is technically still a failure and only visually elevated to facilitate the evaluation of the report.

Please keep in mind that `@Fails` has an impact to <<Failure Corridor>>.

`@Fails` should not be used in conjunction with TestNG `@DataProvider` because the detected failure is ambiguous and might not be valid for all provided data.

====

== Add additional information

You can add additional information to describe the cause in more detail. All information are added to the report.

[source,java]
----
@Test
@Fails(description="This test fails for reasons")
public void testItWillFail() {
    Assert.assertTrue(false);
}
----

.Possible attributes for the `Fails` annotation
[cols="2,5",options="header"]
|===
| Attribute | Description
| description | Give more details about the failure.
| ticketString | Define a bug ticket ID or URL as a String value.
| intoReport | If `true` the failing test is shown as `Failed` instead of `Expected Failed` (default: `false`).
| validator | Define a method that checks if the expected failure is valid.
| validatorClass | Define a class for the `validator` method (optional)
|===

== Defining a validator

With expected fails validators, you can define if the  `Expected Failed` state is valid or not.
When the validator returns `true`, the expected failed status is valid, otherwise, the test will result in a regular `Failed`.
You can use that feature to mark a test as expecting to fail for known circumstances, like browser or environment configurations.

You define a validator the following way:

[source, java]
----
public boolean browserCouldFail(MethodContext methodContext) {
    return methodContext.readSessionContexts()
                .map(SessionContext::getActualBrowserName)
                .anyMatch(s -> s.contains("internet explorer"));
}

@Test
@Fails(validator = "browserCouldFail")
public void testSomething() {
    // Perform your tests here
}
----

Or as a class:

[source, java]
----
public class FailsValidator {
    public boolean expectedFailIsValid(MethodContext methodContext) {
        return true;
    }
}
----

[source, java]
----
@Test
@Fails(validatorClass = FailsValidator.class, validator = "expectedFailIsValid")
public void testSomething() {
    // Perform your tests here
}
----

Example for expected fails on a specific Exceptions:

[source, java]
----
public class FailsValidator {
    public boolean expectedFailOnCertainException(MethodContext methodContext) {
        // of course it's possible to check for more things inside the throwable
        return methodContext.getTestNgResult().isPresent()
                && methodContext.getTestNgResult().get().getThrowable()
                   instanceof CertainException;
    }
}
----

[source, java]
----
@Test
@Fails(validatorClass = FailsValidator.class, validator = "expectedFailOnCertainException")
public void test_customFails() throws CertainException {
    throw new CertainException();
}
----

== Define conditions (`@deprecated`)

You can specify some conditions for expected fails. Only if *_all_* conditions are true, the test is marked as `Expected failed`, otherwise as `Failed`.

.The conditions are based on properties specified in `test.properties`
[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
# test.properties
environment=test
country=de
----

.Usage of validFor in the `@Fails` annotation
[source, java]
----
@Test
@Fails(description = "Failing for environment 'test' and country 'de'", validFor = {"environment=test", "country=de"})
public void testExpectedFailed() {
    Assert.fail();
}
----

If the test is executed with other values of the properties (like country=uk) the test will marked as `Failed`.
