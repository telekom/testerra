[#ExecutionAbortion]
= Report of aborted test runs

In case of unexpected abortion of a test execution the report is generated, too. Due to abortion of still running test methods
some information can be missing, like result states or execution time.

Testerra additionally provides a mechanism to implicitly create a test report when an unexpected exit of the current execution occurred. All existing information created until the moment of the abortion are collected to generate a report.
This might lead to missing as information like the execution time, result states and screenshots might be abandoned if running test methods have been interrupted.

A hint indicating the possibly incomplete state of the report is shown as a warning in the section 'priority messages'.
The report generation in case of abortion of the test execution is described in detail in the paragraph <<#JvmExitHook, JVMExitHook>>.
