= JVMMonitor
include::../properties/property-attributes.adoc[]

The `JVMMonitor` is the Observer of the hardware utilization for memory and cpu.
With the start of a test while using the `TesterraListener` the latter implicitly starts the `JVMMonitor`.
Thus a concurrent thread for monitoring purposes only is initiated next to the actual test execution. Every ten seconds the following parameters are logged at DEBUG Level.

* JVM Memory usage      in MB
* JVM Memory reserved   in MB
* JVM CPU usage         in per cent

The `JVMMonitor` is automatically terminated after the test execution and a graph showing the memory consumption is put into the report.
