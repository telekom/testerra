= Element Highlighting

== Demo mode
In the demo mode actions on pages are marked with distinctive coloured frames around the element of the action. This mechanism is set by a property:

.test.properties
[source, properties,subs="attributes"]
----
# activate demo mode, default = false
{demomode}=true
----
The following colours are used for highlighting

* [red]#red#: failed visibility checks and asserts
* [green]#green#: successful visibility checks and asserts
* [yellow]#yellow#: mouseOver
* [blue]#blue#: click

The highlighting is removed after a timeout of 2000 ms. You can set a custom timeout:

.test.properties
[source, properties,subs="attributes"]
----
# Set a custom timeout in ms
# 0 -> infinite timeout
# default is 2000
{demomode_timeout}=5000
----
